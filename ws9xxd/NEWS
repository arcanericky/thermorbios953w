Changes to 0.0.3

* Improvements to playing back of recorded weather data (--play-data-file)
  which is used for testing.
* Improvements to the help text (--help)
* Added support for monitoring an unknown data type.  If anyone has
  any suggestions of what it may be, please let me know.  This may be
  the wireless signal strength.  Example unknown data is:
  2008-09-25,10:57:54,01/03/06,17:03:00,,Unknown,1,?
* Better command line options for controlling the output of ws9xxd.
* Prevent example programs from being installed when "make install" is
  used.
* Bug fixes for improving the success rate of ws9xxd in telling the
  weather station to start sending data.
* Bug fixes for the user level calls to the kernel that write data
  to the weather station.
* Bug fixes and improvements to adjusting the inside/outside temperature
  and the pressure.
* Two output options.  A human readable format that is no longer the
  default, and a comma seperated value format that has been made
  the default.
* Port code to a big endian machine.  This is especially to get
  the code running on an NSLU2.
* Added a dists directory to contain examples of how to integrate ws9xxd
  with different distributions.
* Move writing to the weather station device improvements from ws9xxd
  to examples/example.c
