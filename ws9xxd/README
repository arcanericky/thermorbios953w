BW9xx Weather Station Daemon
============================

The weather station daemon is a program to connect to the Thermor / BIOS
weather stations, read and intrepret the data coming from the station,
and serve the processed data to any number of clients that connect to it.

The program has been used successfully with the BW953 and BW976 weather
stations.

**************************************************************************

This program is not meant to be used alone.  To get the most out of it,
a client program that connects to this ws9xx daemon must be
used.  With the ws9xxd distribution, there is an example client
(wsdclient) included.  You can also use wview.  A patch is available
that allows one to patch, compile, and use wview.  Details for this
can be found at the end of this document.

Compile and install according the the instructions in INSTALL.  It
shouldn't take more than the standard "./configure", "make", and
"make install".

The ws9xx daemon needs at least one important piece of
information given to it to know how to connect to your weather station,
and that is the USB device name.

A quick check would be to try to locate /dev/hiddev? or /dev/usb/hiddev?
and try to confirm that it is your weather station.  Does that
device file appear when you plug the weather station in?  Does it
disappear when you unplug the weather station?  If so, then you've
probably found it.

TODO
[Add more detailed instructions here]

Once you've found the proper device name, start ws9xxd, giving it the
device name and run it in the foreground so you can observe the output
and error messages, if any.  Depending on the permissions of the USB
device, you may need to run the ws9xx daemon as root.  For
example, on a test system, the device is at /dev/usb/hiddev0, requiring
ws9xxd to be ran as:
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/ws9xxd --device-name /dev/usb/hiddev0 --foreground

A successful run should yield weather statistics to the screen.  Stop the
program by pressing Ctrl-C.  An example run is:

Once you've verified the ws9xx daemon is connecting to, and reading
data from the weather station as shown above, you should verify that
the data is available to any client that wishes to use it.  Run the ws9xx
daemon, leaving out the foreground option.  The program will detach
and run in the background.  You can now find the same output as
above at /tmp/ws9xxd.log while the daemon is running.

Run the example client included with the distribution. You can find this
client at examples/wsdclient.  It will connect to the weather station
using the Unix Domain Socket at /tmp/wsd, then retrieve and display the
data until you stop it with Ctrl-C.  You should see output very similar
to that of the log file.  There should be no need to run it with root
privileges.  Any program can connect to the ws9xx daemon and use the
data.  An examle call is:
$ examples/wsdclient 

And again, the output is similar to the above log file:
2008-09-25,10:39:06,01/03/06,16:45:00,Minimum,Inside Temperature,20.6,C
2008-09-25,10:39:06,01/03/06,16:45:00,Maximum,Inside Temperature,24.3,C
2008-09-25,10:39:06,01/03/06,16:45:00,Current,Inside Temperature,22.6,C
2008-09-25,10:39:06,01/03/06,16:45:00,Minimum,Outside Temperature,19.1,C
2008-09-25,10:39:06,01/03/06,16:45:00,Maximum,Outside Temperature,32.5,C
2008-09-25,10:39:06,01/03/06,16:45:00,Current,Outside Temperature,25.1,C

From here, you can do a number of things.  For example, can write your own
client (perhaps a GUI) based on the example code provided.  You may want
to automatically start the ws9xx daemon when it's plugged into your machine.
You may find examples showing how to do this using udev in the dists
directory.  There is currently one at:
dists/linux/debian/ubuntu/etc/udev/rules.d/50-bw9xxd.rules
If you have a different distribution or find a different method, please
let me know and we'll include it on a future release.

TODO
[Add information about using wview here]
Perhaps refer them to the wview patch download (when one is created).
