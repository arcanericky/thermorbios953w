* Download a copy of wview 4.0.1 (http://www.wviewweather.com).
* Read the wview documentation.
* Compile wview, enabling the Simulator Station (--enable-station-sim).
* Install wview (make install-env).
* Learn to start wview, view the web pages, and stop wview using
  the Station Simulator.

You should only proceed once you have wview and the Station Simulator set
up and working.  There is a fairly steep learning curve involved, and
any problems you have here need to be addressed with wview.  This
documentation does not address setting up and learning to use wview.

Once you've done this, the remainder of the document will be relatively
straightforward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------
Install GNU Autotools
---------------------
Before continuing, you need to install a few of the GNU Autotools
utilities.  The patch modifies configure.in, and a few of the Makefile.am
files.  These are used as input to the GNU Autotools to create
configure and the Makefile.in files, which is normally done for you before
you download a distributed program.  Installation of these tools is
distribution dependent.  You'll need to determine how to do this.  The
programs you will need are:
  - aclocal
  - autoconf
  - automake

On an Ubuntu / Debian system, these can be installed with:
	$ sudo apt-get install automake autoconf

-------------
Install Patch
-------------
You will also need to install a program called "patch" to patch the
source code of wview.  Again, installation is distribution dependent and
it may already be installed for you.

On an Ubuntu / Debian system, it can be installed with:
	$ sudo apt-get install patch

------------------------
Apply the Patch to wview
------------------------
The patch is applied by applying it using the program "patch", with the
-p1 option from inside the wview root directory.
	$ cd wview-4.0.1
	$ patch -p1 < /path/to/wview-4.0.1.pat

You should see output similar to:
	patching file configure.in
	patching file stations/Makefile.am
	patching file stations/BW9xx/bw9xx.c
	patching file stations/BW9xx/bw9xx.h
	patching file stations/BW9xx/Makefile.am
	patching file wviewconfig/Makefile.am
	patching file wviewconfig/wviewconfig.sh

-------------------------
Update the Build Routines
-------------------------
The modified configure.in and Makefile.am files must now be processed and
converted to configure and Makefile.in files.  This is done with the GNU
Autotools mentioned above.  Again, from the wview root directory:
	$ aclocal
	$ autoconf
	$ automake

----------------------------
Configure, Make, and Install
----------------------------
Everything is now ready for you to configure, make and install wview just
like you did with the Station Simulator.  There should be nothing new
here - just repeating the steps you did when you were learning to use
wview with the Station Simulator except you must use the
--enable-station-bw9xx option.
	$ ./configure --enable-station-bw9xx
	$ make

And when done, you'll need to choose between "make install", which only
installs the binaries, and "make install-env" which will install both
the binaries and configuration files (which you may have already changed
and may not want to overwrite).

You should now be ready to use wview, ws9xxd and your station.  Make sure
your weather station is connected, then start ws9xxd.  Check the log file
for ws9xxd to make sure it is emitting data, then start wview.  Give it a
few minutes, and you should begin to find live data in your html files
you learned to use when running the Station Simulator.
